    <p class="aboutme2"> About me and my love to travel! </p>
    <p class="section2"> Airplanes. Our family’s life revolves around these amazing, technical machines that transport us around the globe. My mother,  she works for United. My brother, he works for Boeing. Even my cousin works for Booking.com! And myself? Well I found myself interning with United over the summer.  My dad is the odd one out, yet he spends just as much time interacing with airplanes as the rest of us.
	Because of my mom’s job, we fly for free. Not only is this a huge blessing, but it has also changed our travel and life dynamics. We’ve always been a family who prioritized travel, but since my mom started her United job, my love and desire to see and experience the world has grown. </p>

    <p class="section3"> We have been to so many places including many countries within Europe, Australia, Japan, Singapore etc. but my list for places I still want to explore continues to grow.
	However, the catch to flying for free is flying standby. That’s the uncertainty, yet adventerous part of it all. We have become pros at planning, packing and booking last minute. We learned to be extremely flexible and just roll with the punches. We never know where we might end up next! One time we packed for a trip to London but when we got to the airport the flight was full. So we looked on the boards and saw a flight to Brussels leaving at the same time. So we went there instead!
	None of this is me trying to brag or boast. But to understand me and where I come from and how I was raised is to understand this huge part of my life. Along with my love for travel came my passion for photography. If I’m traveling, you can bet I have a camera attached to my hip at all times. It has become my second favorite hobby.
	I hope to someday combine my passion for photography and my interest in visual communications to become some sort of art director or designer in the travel industry, whether it may be editorial or corporate driven. Hopefully in this class I begin to find my creative style and learn some awesome and important artistic techniques. </p>
